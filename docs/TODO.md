You now have:
	•	A clean multi-file agent scaffold (planner → executor → critic → orchestrator)
	•	Dynamic tool routing with a registry
	•	Robust executor with max-attempts guard and real tool execution
	•	Math intent parser that handles add/sub/mul/div (including symbols)
	•	A pytest suite covering happy path, echo fallback, division-by-zero, and guard behavior

If you want to keep leveling it up, here are sensible next steps:
	1.	Logging & run history

	•	Append JSONL traces to logs/runs.jsonl after each run().
	•	Include prompt, plan, outcome, and error details.

	2.	Config-driven tools & thresholds

	•	Move _TOOL_REGISTRY and acceptance criteria into config/default.yaml.
	•	Let the planner read constraints (e.g., max steps) from config.

	3.	More tools

	•	web.search(query), files.read(path), code.run(py) (sandboxed), etc.
	•	Add a router rule to prefer web tool when prompt contains URL/domain keywords.

	4.	Retry policy per step

	•	Backoff and retry on transient tool errors.
	•	Reset state/result between retries; stop at max_attempts.

	5.	Memory / evidence

	•	Append tool outputs to state["evidence"].
	•	Let the critic verify summaries against evidence.

	6.	CLI niceties

	•	Add --json to print only the result dict.
	•	Add --op/--a/--b passthrough as a first-class feature in planner/orchestrator.

Want me to implement any of the above (e.g., logging to logs/runs.jsonl + --json flag) right now?
